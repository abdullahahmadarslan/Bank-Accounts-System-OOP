## Account Classes
- **Account**: This is the base class for accounts. It contains common attributes like CNIC, account number, account title, and balance. It also handles deposit, withdrawal, and balance checking.
- **CurrentAccount**: Inherits from `Account`, includes an additional service fee that is applied to transactions.
- **SavingsAccount**: Inherits from `Account`, includes a monthly interest rate that can be applied to the account balance.

## File Handling
The account data is stored in a file called `bank.ser` using Javaâ€™s serialization mechanism. The following methods handle file operations:
- `openFileInWriteMode()`: Opens the file for writing account data.
- `openFileInReadMode()`: Opens the file for reading account data.
- `writeToFile()`: Writes the account data to the file.
- `readFromFile()`: Reads account data from the file.
- `inputStreamClose()` and `outputStreamClose()`: Close the file streams after reading or writing.
